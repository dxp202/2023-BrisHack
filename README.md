Arcadia is a unique VR game built in Unity3D that explores the theme of "My Utopia". Hosted by CSS Bristol, the game invites players to create and design their own vision of a perfect utopian society. The objective of the game is to dream up a project that helps us get closer to what each player envisions as a utopian society.

Players will embark on a journey that involves various challenges and tasks, such as designing infrastructure, housing, and other essential components of their utopia. They will also have the opportunity to interact with other players in the game, sharing ideas and collaborating to build a shared vision of a utopian society.

The game may feature elements of city-building and management simulation games, such as SimCity or Cities: Skylines, adapted for a VR experience. This will allow players to have a more immersive and interactive way to explore their own ideas of a utopian society.

In addition, Arcadia may also focus on storytelling and narrative, presenting players with a variety of scenarios and challenges, each with its own unique ethical and philosophical questions to consider. The game provides an opportunity for players to gain a deeper understanding of their own values and beliefs, as well as those of others.

Arcadia is a game that appeals to a broad range of players, from fans of simulation and strategy games to those interested in exploring philosophical questions about society and the future. The VR format of the game makes it more accessible and engaging for players who are looking for a more immersive and interactive experience.

Overall, Arcadia is a thought-provoking and compelling game that encourages players to think critically about their own ideas of a utopian society.
